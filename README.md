# Microsoft Teams and Guest Access

Teams guest access can be enabled or disabled for an organization - the setting is disabled by default and applies across the organization's tenant. But how does an organization enable the feature only for select, authorized teams? And once enabled, how does an organization protect it's information while being shared with guests? The answers to these questions require a deeper understanding of Teams architecture and Microsoft 365 security and compliance capabilities. This is discussed in the Automating the Provisioning of Selective Teams with Guest Access blog series.
